# module
In this repository i created module for drupal 8. With this module i studied the Plugin API and created derivatives for custom plugin.
Added form, with this form i can create a new plugin instances.

If you want test my module you need install this module, after install module create table in database, in this table the module save information about deposits.
After install you need go to the path SiteName/deposit, and create plugins. Good luck.
